1.What is gaze-based interaction?
	Gaze-based interaction is when the system responds to where the user is looking, using the camera to simulate eye tracking.

2.Why is dwell time useful?
	Dwell time helps select objects without clicking by using how long the user looks at an object, reducing accidental actions.


3.How does sensory feedback improve realism?
	Sensory feedback makes interactions feel more real by combining visual changes with sound, which better matches human perception.


4.Which cube felt most immersive and why?
	The cube with color change, size change, and sound felt most immersive because it used multiple senses, making the interaction feel more realistic and engaging.
